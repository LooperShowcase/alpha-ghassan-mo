   <p>Applications of binary codeComputers rely on binary code in many everyday digital operations. Central processing units, also called CPUs, use binary to execute logical and arithmetic operations. When a computer sends information, it usually encodes that information into binary format, decoding it back into its original format after transmission. Itâ€™s a fundamental principle of digital communication. </p>

1. Calculations
For example, when a sum is calculated, the calculator transforms the numbers into binary and then converts the result back into a decimal number format.

    2. File compression and decompression
Compression algorithms use binary to represent data in more compact formats. This transformation reduces the storage space, enabling more efficient data management.

<ol>
    3. Security
Cryptographic algorithms employ binary code to carry out operations like encryption and decryption. Doing so helps to protect data and secure its transmission and storage.

    4. Digital clock
Digital clocks can use binary settings to control LED lights and keep track of time. Separate binary counters add seconds, minutes, and hours to ensure the clock displays the correct time.

    5. Media processing
During audio or video processing, streams of binary data make up the media files. Computers then decode and transform these streams back into analog signals for playback.
